### Introduction
- This notebook analyzes customer behavior for that we have BigMarts Sales data collected in 2013 which is bifurcated in train (8523 records & 12 attributes) and test (5681 records & 11 attributes) data set, train data set has both independant and dependant variable(s) given below

### Hypothesis
- 1) Locality: Outlet in populated locality should generate more revenue
- 2) Spending Capacity: Tier 1 should have more spending capacity than tier 2 and tier 3
- 3) Product Selection: Tier 1 should prefer low fat content food as they tend to be more aware of their health
- 4) Item Visiblity: More visible Item should have more revenue generating power
- 5) Area: Stores which have early establishment could have higher outlet size
- 6) MRP: Consumers prefer reasonable product or Branded products

### Problem Statment
- We need to analyse the dataset and come up with more insights and our main task is to predict the Sales figure for the test dataset.

### Approach
- 1) By applying Exploratory Data Analysis we will identify the relation between different attributes and evaluate meaningful information.
- 2) By applying different supervised machine learning algorithms we will predict the sales for test dataset.

### Aim of the Project
- The main objective is to find the sales per product for each store and evaluate meaningful insights.
- Using this model, BigMart will try to understand different attributes of the product and apply them to increase their overall sales.

### Structure
Part1: Libraries for doing EDA process
Part2: Exploring the Dataset
Part3: Visualisation of Data
Part4: Preparing the data by using Machine Learing
Part 5: Conculsion

### Conclusion
- Random Forest is best performing Model
- MRP has huge correlation with the Outlet Sales
- For better performance we need parameter tuning
