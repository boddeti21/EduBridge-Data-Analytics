- Coronavirus is a family of viruses that are named after their spiky crown. 
- The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious respiratory virus that first reported in Wuhan, China. 
- On 2/11/2020, the World Health Organization designated the name COVID-19 for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
- This notebook aims at exploring COVID-19 through data analysis and projections.

### Conclusion
- A new coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province
- People developed pneumonia without a clear cause and for which existing vaccines or treatments were not effective.
- The virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission
- Transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to escalate in mid-January 2020
- As of 30 January 2020, approximately 8,243 cases have been confirmed

# 2. IPL Auction 2022
- The TATA IPL 2022 mega auction is conducted on 12 and 13 February 2022 in Bengaluru. A total of 590 players were selected for the auction.

# 3. Foods in India
- What did you eat today? Wondering if you are eating a healthy diet? Automatic food identification can assist towards food intake monitoring to maintain a healthy diet.
- Food classification is a challenging problem due to the large number of food categories, high visual similarity between different food categories, as well as the lack of datasets that are large enough for training deep models.
- In this competition, we extend our last year's dataset to 251 fine-grained (prepared) food categories with 118,475 training images collected from the web.We provide human verified labels for both the validation set of 11,994 images and the test set of 28,377 images.
- The goal is to build a model to predict the fine-grained food-category label given an image.
