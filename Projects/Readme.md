### Exploratory Data Analysis in Python:

#### 1. Application Of Descriptive Analytics : IPL Auction 2022
- By Visualization and Descriptive Statistics finding the Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings contrasting buys, sold and unsold players in the auction, highest auction player and overseas auction player in 2022

#### 2. Application of Descriptive Analytics : iFood
- In this competition, we extend our last year's dataset to 251 fine-grained (prepared) food categories with 118,475 training images collected from the web.
- We provide human verified labels for both the validation set of 11,994 images and the test set of 28,377 images.
- The goal is to build a model to predict the fine-grained food-category label given an image.

### Web-scrapping using Python

- Web Scraping - Using BeautifulSoup
- Link Used for Scraping: 
https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=iphone+13+pro+max&sid=tyy%2C4io&as=on&as-show=on&otracker=AS_QueryStore_OrganicAutoSuggest_2_6_na_na_na&otracker1=AS_QueryStore_OrganicAutoSuggest_2_6_na_na_na&as-pos=2&as-type=RECENT&suggestionId=iphone+13+pro+max%7CMobiles&requestId=970df2f0-611d-4908-a5d2-1bd630787530&as-searchtext=iphone
- Medium Used: Jupyter Notebook (Python)

### Objective:
- Scrap model,price,rating,product name from the website.
- After Scraping Save all the scraped data into a dataset.
- Export the saved dataset into a csv file and name it as "iphone13promax.csv"

### Conclusion:
- From the scraping of Apple Iphone13promax 16.7% of people gave rating as 4.6 for the product and 83.3% of people gave rating as 4.7 for the product.
As the new version are intoducing there is more sales on the Iphone products.
