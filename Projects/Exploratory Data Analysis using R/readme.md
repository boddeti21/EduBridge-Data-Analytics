- What did you eat today? Wondering if you are eating a healthy diet? Automatic food identification can assist towards food intake monitoring to maintain a healthy diet.
- Food classification is a challenging problem due to the large number of food categories, high visual similarity between different food categories, as well as the lack of datasets that are large enough for training deep models.
- In this competition, we extend our last year's dataset to 251 fine-grained (prepared) food categories with 118,475 training images collected from the web.We provide human verified labels for both the validation set of 11,994 images and the test set of 28,377 images.
- The goal is to build a model to predict the fine-grained food-category label given an image.

### Program Language

- Part 4: Cleaning the data
- Part 5: Analysing and Visualization the data
- part 6: Conclusion

### Conclusion
- From this data set, It's showing that there were 255 variety of food items in this data.
- Among this vegetarian food items were more. The food items in non veg were very less compared to vegetarian.
- There is no much difference between cooking and preparation time of vegetarian and non vegetarian foods.
- The food items were mainly sweet and spicy flavors. The flavors were different in different regions.
- The spicy food items were mainly from the states such as Chhattisgarh, Gujrat, Haryana, Nagaland, NCT of Delhi,Tripura.

- Suicide is the taking of one's own life. It is a death that happens when someone harms themselves because they want to end their life. A suicide attempt is when someone harms themselves to try to end their life, but they do not die. 
- Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young adults worldwide. There is a growing recognition that prevention strategies need to be tailored to the region-specific demographics of a country and to be implemented in a culturally-sensitive manner.
- The suicide rate in lots of countries have been quite high for many years, including the developing and developed countries. 
- At the begining, we'll see the suicide rate of sex, and then the age and generation.

- part 6: Conclusion

### Conclusion
- In general, the suicide rate is related to several factors.
- First, national GDP per person. We have seen that the suicide rate in many countries is highly correlated with the gdp of the whole country, which shows that the degree of national wealth has a certain degree of reduction in suicide rate.
- Second, the age. According to the suicide rate of each level of age, the rate of elderly is higher, so young people should care more about the elderly. Moreover, the country welfare of the elderly may also impact the rate.
- Third, the social pressure. A healthy society can make citizens feel safe and satisfied, so how to relieve the social pressure becomes a significant topic for every country. Our purpose is not only reduce the suicide rate but also to build a better world.
